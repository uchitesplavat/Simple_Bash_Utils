In text mode, the default when reading is to convert platform-specific line endings (\n on Unix, \r\n on Windows) to just \n. When w

platform-specific line endings. This behind-the-scenes modification to file data is fine for text files, but will corrupt binary data 
like that in JPEG or EXE files. Be very careful to use binary mode when reading and writing such files.
